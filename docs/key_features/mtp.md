## 📚 Overview

Multi-token prediction trains recurrent auxiliary depths alongside the main head.
At sequence position `i`, the main head predicts token `i+1`, MTP depth 0 predicts
`i+2`, depth 1 predicts `i+3`, and so on. An inference engine later executes the
same depth-specific layers one speculative step at a time as its draft model.
Qwen3.5 checkpoints ship pretrained MTP weights under the `mtp.` prefix, but
upstream `transformers` 5.16.1 has no MTP module — only
`_keys_to_ignore_on_load_unexpected = [r"^mtp.*"]`. Before this feature those
tensors were loaded and discarded, so continued training silently degraded the
MTP head relative to the trunk.

Currently supported through `tasks/train_text.py` and `tasks/train_vlm.py`:
**Qwen3.5 dense** (`Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration`) and **Qwen3.5 MoE**
(`Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGeneration`) on GPU and Ascend NPU. DPO and RL trainers
do not support MTP. The NPU path uses FLA's Ascend dispatch for the GatedDeltaNet
kernels.

## 🚀 Quick Start

MTP has a single knob, on the *text* config:

```yaml
model:
  model_path: /path/to/Qwen3.5-2B
  ops_implementation:
    attn_implementation: flash_attention_2
    # Strongly recommended with MTP: the head runs a second full-vocab projection,
    # and the eager loss would materialize a second [tokens, vocab_size] fp32
    # logits tensor.
    cross_entropy_loss_implementation: liger_kernel
  model_config:
    text_config:
      mtp_loss_weight: 0.3
```

On Ascend, install `flash-linear-attention>=0.5.2` and a CANN-compatible
`triton-ascend`, then run the provided 27B configuration:

```shell
bash train.sh tasks/train_text.py configs/text/qwen3_5_27b_mtp_npu.yaml
```

Its three GatedDeltaNet implementation fields select FLA's native Ascend dispatch.

MTP is disabled when `mtp_loss_weight` is unset, `null`, or non-positive, or when
`mtp_num_hidden_layers` is unset, `null`, or non-positive. In all of these cases,
the module is never constructed, no `mtp.*` parameters exist, and load / DCP /
export behave exactly as they did before MTP support existed. There is deliberately
no second boolean flag: `mtp_num_hidden_layers` describes the checkpoint architecture,
and MTP is enabled only when both the layer count and loss weight are positive.

The weight is applied inside the model, so **`training/mtp_loss` in the logs is the
weighted contribution**. `BaseTrainer.postforward` sums the loss dict, so whatever is
in it is the optimized objective. Set `mtp_loss_weight: 1.0` to read the raw MTP
cross-entropy.

Expected log line:

```text
total_loss: 2.03, foundation_loss: 1.52, mtp_loss: 0.51, grad_norm: 50.92, lr: 0.00
```

## 🔍 How the MTP head works

The module layout mirrors the checkpoint exactly, and the forward mirrors vLLM's
inference implementation (`vllm/model_executor/models/qwen3_5_mtp.py`), which is the
deployment contract:

```text
h[-1] = trunk_hidden
for depth in range(mtp_num_hidden_layers):
    e_shift[depth, i] = inputs_embeds[i + depth + 1]  # tail slots zero-filled
    h[depth] = fc(cat([pre_fc_norm_embedding(e_shift[depth]),
                       pre_fc_norm_hidden(h[depth - 1])], dim=-1))
    h[depth] = mtp.layers[depth](h[depth], ...)       # one layer for this depth
    h[depth] = mtp.norm(h[depth])
    target[depth, i] = labels[i + depth + 2]

logits = lm_head(stack(h))                            # shared with the main head
loss   = CE(logits, stack(target))                    # mean over valid depth tokens
```

Three details are load-bearing and easy to get backwards. Each was verified
numerically against the pretrained weights (see the table under [Cost](#-cost) for
the method):

| Detail | Correct | If you get it wrong |
|---|---|---|
| `fc` input order | **embedding first**, `cat([emb, hidden])` | Multiplies the hidden state by `fc.weight`'s embedding half. Loss jumps to ~9x — above `ln(vocab_size)`, i.e. worse than uniform. |
| Which trunk hidden state | **post**-final-norm (the trunk's returned `last_hidden_state`) | `pre_fc_norm_hidden` was trained on the normed distribution; loss rises ~1.3x. |
| positions / rotary | **not shifted inside the parallel training row** — reuse the trunk's `position_embeddings` at every depth | Rolling the already-packed training positions would desynchronize the pretrained one-depth Qwen3.5 contract. |

The head shares `embed_tokens` and `lm_head` with the main model: the released
checkpoints carry neither `mtp.embed_tokens` nor `mtp.lm_head`, and
`mtp_use_dedicated_embeddings` is `False` (asserted at construction).

For Qwen3.5-MoE, enabling `output_router_logits` applies one load-balancing
auxiliary loss across both trunk routers and every MTP depth. Trunk router rows
use the regular attention mask; MTP depth `d` uses
`mtp_labels[:, d] != IGNORE_INDEX`, so shifted tail positions and masked targets
do not affect expert-balancing statistics. The combined auxiliary term is
controlled by `router_aux_loss_coef`; `mtp_loss_weight` continues to scale only
the MTP cross-entropy contribution.

## Plumbing

### The MTP label row

`ForCausalLMLoss` shifts labels by one internally when SP is disabled
(`veomni/ops/kernels/cross_entropy/__init__.py`), so position `i` of the main head
predicts `labels[i+1]`. MTP depth `d` instead needs `labels[i+d+2]`. The data
transform therefore builds `mtp_labels` with shape `[batch, depth, sequence]`, and
the model supplies it as an explicit `shift_labels=` argument that bypasses the
internal shift.

The row is built on the **per-sample encode path**, before the sample reaches
`MainCollator`: `ChatTemplate.encode_messages` adds it for conversation and
Qwen-VL samples. Plain-text transforms do not currently synthesize MTP rows,
so MTP-enabled SFT should use one of the conversation transforms. Building
every depth shift per sample is important: shifting by two inside an already-
packed row would pull the next sample's first tokens into the tail of the
current one.
`mtp_labels` is part of `DEFAULT_DATA_COLLATE_INFO` with the rule
`(-1, True, IGNORE_INDEX, 1)`. The depth dimension is retained while samples are
concatenated along the final sequence dimension. This default rule matters
beyond SP: `pad_to_length` pads every `pack_dim == -1` key with its `sp_pad_value`,
so an unregistered row would be left short. It also makes `count_loss_token`
emit `mtp_tokens` for free (it derives `{prefix}_tokens` from any `*_labels` key).
The model flattens batch and depth for one fused loss call, so `mtp_tokens` is the
exact denominator across all valid depth targets, including under gradient
accumulation.

`MTPLabelMixin` infers MTP depth from
`{tokenizer.name_or_path}/config.json`. A Hub identifier or missing config file
silently yields depth zero; supplying MTP labels in that case makes the MTP
forward raise because `mtp_labels` is missing. Enabling MTP requires a local
tokenizer/config path.

### Loss dictionary contract

Per-head losses are returned in `output.loss` as a dictionary with
`foundation_loss` and `mtp_loss` entries. The model assigns this dictionary
after constructing the output object, and the trainer's loss utilities preserve
the keys for token-normalized reduction and logging.

The individual tensors remain reachable through the regular `ModelOutput` pytree,
which is required by FSDP2's pre-backward unshard hook.

### `mtp_context`

The MTP head needs four tensors that only exist inside `Qwen3_5TextModel.forward`:
the post-vision-scatter `inputs_embeds`, the normalized `position_ids`, the trunk's
`position_embeddings`, and the `causal_mask`. `Qwen3_5ModelOutputWithPast` carries
only `last_hidden_state` / `past_key_values` / `rope_deltas`, so they are threaded
out through an added `mtp_context` field (`Qwen3_5MTPContextOutput`).

Recomputing them one level up would re-embed `input_ids` *without* the scattered
vision features — silently wrong for multimodal batches. `mtp_context` is populated
only when an enabled MTP head is asked to compute a labeled objective, including
both training and evaluation. Label-free inference and MTP-off runs allocate
nothing extra.

## 💾 Checkpoints

The module is registered at the top level as `ForConditionalGeneration.mtp`, so live
parameter FQNs are exactly `mtp.*` — identical to the released checkpoint. For dense
models, that alignment makes all three paths work with no MTP-specific code:

- **HF weight load** — `load_model_weights` matches by name; no conversion mapping.
- **DCP save/resume** — `get_model_state_dict` picks the params up automatically.
  A saved checkpoint contains 15 `model.mtp.*` parameters plus 45
  `optimizer.state.mtp.*` AdamW entries.
- **HF safetensors export** — `get_model_save_state` hard-drops any FQN missing from
  the index-derived `fqn_to_index_mapping`, and the shipped
  `model.safetensors.index.json` already lists all 15 `mtp.*` keys. Registering the
  module under `model.language_model.mtp.*` instead would have it **silently
  discarded** on export.

Qwen3.5-MoE checkpoints keep trunk experts fused but store MTP experts as per-expert
`gate_proj` / `up_proj` / `down_proj` tensors. The model-specific checkpoint converter
merges only those MTP keys into the generated model's fused expert layout at load time.

⚠️ **Do not toggle MTP across a resume.** `set_model_state_dict` is strict, so
resuming a pre-MTP checkpoint with `mtp_loss_weight` set fails on missing keys, and
the optimizer param groups change shape too. Enable MTP from step 0 off HF weights.

## 📉 Cost

MTP adds `mtp_num_hidden_layers` recurrent decoder layers and one shared-head
projection per depth. The depth rows are batched into one loss-kernel call, but the
projection FLOPs still scale linearly with the number of depths. Lowering
`mtp_loss_weight` changes the objective but does not reduce this compute.

On Qwen3.5-35B-A3B with 16 Ascend ranks, EP16, sequence length 1024 and one MTP
layer, a warm-cache 20-step comparison measured 3.36s without MTP and 3.49s with
MTP per step (median, +3.9%). Peak memory increased from 43.95GB to 44.89GB (+2.1%).

## 🚧 Limitations

- **Sequence parallel is rejected**, with an assert at construction. Two independent
  reasons: the `inputs_embeds` left-shift crosses rank boundaries, and
  `ForCausalLMLoss` *silently ignores* `shift_labels` when `sp_enabled`, which would
  train the head on 1-shifted labels behind nothing louder than a `warning_once`.
- **Training only.** Speculative decoding runs in the inference engine; the forward
  asserts `past_key_values is None`.
- **SFT only.** Text and Qwen3.5 VLM trainers construct MTP labels; DPO and RL do not.
- **Multimodal shift semantics differ slightly from vLLM.** vLLM rotates `input_ids`
  then embeds; training shifts the already-scattered `inputs_embeds`. Equivalent for
  text, and only different at multimodal placeholder boundaries.
- `output_hidden_states=True` gains one entry: `_can_record_outputs` captures by
  `Qwen3_5DecoderLayer` class, so `mtp.layers.0`'s output is collected too. Code
  indexing `hidden_states[-2]` is affected.
- `EnvironMeter`'s MFU/FLOPs accounting does not include the MTP head, so reported
  MFU is an underestimate when MTP is on.
- **Ascend NPU is supported.** Use `configs/text/qwen3_5_27b_mtp_npu.yaml` as the
  dense-model reference; MoE uses the same MTP knob and FLA Ascend operator settings.

## Supporting MTP for a new model

The trainer-side loss plumbing (`output.loss` dictionaries and
`count_loss_token`'s `{prefix}_tokens`) is model-agnostic. Per model you need,
in its patch config:

1. An MTP `nn.Module` whose submodule names match the checkpoint's `mtp.*` FQNs,
   added with `config.add_helper_after(...)`.
2. A way to reach the trunk's `inputs_embeds` / `position_embeddings` / masks —
   for Qwen3.5 that meant overriding the text model's `forward` to emit
   `mtp_context`.
3. `__init__` overridden to construct the module under the FQN the checkpoint uses,
   plus the SP/EP asserts.
4. Ensure the model's `ChatTemplate.encode_messages` constructs the MTP rows
   before packing. The shared `DEFAULT_DATA_COLLATE_INFO` already contains the
   `mtp_labels` packing rule.
5. `forward` extended with an explicit `mtp_labels` parameter (never left in
   `**kwargs`, which would leak it into the attention and CE kernels) assigning
   the per-head dictionary to `output.loss`.

Note `config.modify_init()` looks like the natural fit for step 3 but is a **dead API**: `PatchType.INIT_MODIFICATION` has no implementation in patchgen's codegen, so
the patch is silently dropped. Use `override_method("<Class>.__init__")`.
