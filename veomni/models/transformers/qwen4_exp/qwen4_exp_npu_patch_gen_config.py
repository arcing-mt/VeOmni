"""Patch configuration for the Qwen4-Exp NPU correctness path.

Regen command:
patchgen veomni.models.transformers.qwen4_exp.qwen4_exp_npu_patch_gen_config -o veomni/models/transformers/qwen4_exp/generated --diff

Qwen4-Exp uses partial interleaved mRoPE and experimental QSA/PLE code paths,
so this initial NPU build deliberately inherits the device-agnostic GPU patch
set without adding incompatible fused rotary or attention replacements.
